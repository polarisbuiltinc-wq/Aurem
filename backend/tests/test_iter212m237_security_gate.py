"""
Iter 212m-237 — Personal Track security gate (Lovable-hardened).

The gate is the SINGLE entry point that decides whether generated
code may enter AUREM-owned infrastructure.  Every attack pattern
below MUST cause `scan_files()` to return `ok=False` and, at the
router level, MUST cause `POST /scaffold/{id}/materialize` to
return HTTP 422 with `reason: "security_scan_failed"` — zero
HTTP 200 in the insecure branch, ever.

Coverage tested:
  1. Hardcoded OpenAI-style API key           (SECRET)
  2. Hardcoded AWS access key                 (SECRET)
  3. Raw MongoDB connection URI               (SECRET)
  4. SQL injection via f-string interpolation (DANGEROUS)
  5. eval() usage                              (DANGEROUS)
  6. subprocess with shell=True               (DANGEROUS — new)
  7. pickle.loads on external data            (DANGEROUS — new)
  8. yaml.load without SafeLoader             (DANGEROUS — new)
  9. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`                 (XSS)
  10. Path-traversal in scaffold path          (PATH SAFETY)

Retroactive coverage: same scan_files() function is used by both
materialize and any redeploy path — locked in by a code search.
