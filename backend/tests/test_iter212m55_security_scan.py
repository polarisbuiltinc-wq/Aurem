"""
test_iter212m55_security_scan.py — regression for the 1-click static
vulnerability scanner introduced in iter 212m-55.

Covers:
  • Route is registered under /api/aurem-dev/security-scan/run
  • Unauthenticated calls return 401
  • Authenticated calls with missing project_id return 400
  • Authenticated calls with bogus project_id return 404
  • The rule library actually fires on a known-bad snippet
  • The NoSQL-op guard still blocks $where in other POST bodies
    (regression from the middleware rewrite needed to keep this
    feature shippable).
